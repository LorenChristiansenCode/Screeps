Requirements:


--------------------ROOMS------------------------------

-Each room should be able to get stats on how many Creeps(of which type).
-Each room should be able to spawn Creeps based on the balance of Creeps in the room.
-Constructions sites will be built by the user for now
-A room should be able to call for Guardians from other rooms when it is under attack



--------------------CREEPS------------------------------

Different Types of Creeps:
-Harvester: At early room levels, harvests energy from sources in the room. In mature rooms, harvesters should be able to carry huge amounts of resources 
    at the expense of the MOVE ability. Links should be constructed at each source, with one harvesters assigned to each link. A small number of harvesters
    will remain near the areas of the room where energy is stored(Spawn, extensions, storage, etc.). These structures should be near to the spawn to preserve 
    efficiency. One harvester will collect energy from a source and transfer to a link. The harvesters near energy storage structures will take energy from
    the appropriate link and transfer to energy storage structures.
-Upgrader: Harvests energy from sources in the room and upgrades the controller. In mature rooms, should pull energy from StructureStorage.
-Builder: Harvests energy from sources in the room. In mature rooms, harvests energy from StructureStorage. Transfers
    energy to constructions sites in the room.
-Repairman: Harvests energy from sources in the room. In mature rooms, harvests energy from the closest available source. Uses energy to repair stuctures,
    excluding walls. 
-Wall Repairman: Harvests energy from sources in the room. In mature rooms, harvests energy from the closest available source. Uses energy to repair walls,
    starting with the wall with the least amount of hit points compared to other walls in the room.
-Guardian: Stays in it's home room and attacks enemy creeps. Blocks openings in the walls where applicable. Shouldn't be spawned until enemies are detected.
-Raider: A pair of Creeps, one to attack, one to heal. Attacking creep should have plenty of armor, and one type of attack. Healer should have a large 
    amount of armor and healing abilities. Both should have the same moving capability. Recommended to send two Raiders; one with ranged attack to attack 
    creeps behind structures, and one with close ranged attack to destory structures.
-Diplomat: Lightweight creep optimized for speed. Needs the ability to claim controllers.
-Scout: Explores a room marked for attack

Creep spawning should be controlled by the Room Captain. 



--------------------EXPANSION------------------------------

A console command should be able to trigger an attack on another room. A source room and target room should be specified in the command.
Attack logic:
    -A lightweight, fast creep should be sent to the room if it isn't currently visible. 
    -If not inhabited by hostile creeps, a Diplomat should be sent to claim the target room's controller.
    -If hostile creeps are detected, stats should be returned on the Owner's GCL and other appropriate strength indicators. If the Owner is deemed weak enough
        to attack, Raiders should be created for an attack. Logic should be created to determine how many(and what kind of) Raiders should be created based on 
        # of defensive structures, wall strength, # of hostile creeps, # of creeps with defensive abilities, etc.
    -Once all defensive structures/creeps have been destroyed, the controller should be attacked. 
    -When the controller is sufficiently weak(or close to it), a Diplomat should be released to claim the controller
    -Special transportation harvesters(or maybe another kind of creep altogether) should be responsible for bringing one time resources to the room once it has 
        been captured to quickly boost the growth of the room in preparation for a counter-attack. Emphasis should be put on upgrading the controller until 
        extensions can be created to allow for strong Guardians to be spawned.
